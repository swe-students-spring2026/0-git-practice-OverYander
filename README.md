# Can I Become a Software Engineer With a Computer Science Degree?
### [Link to Article](https://www.computersciencedegreehub.com/faq/software-engineer-computer-science-degree/)

The primary difference between a **software engineering** and a **computer science** is the scope and application. Computer science is relatively important to software engineers as it involves the theory and computations behind what software engineers apply. Software Engineering is essentially a focused field of the entirety of computer science. Software engineering is generally on the rise and many successful software engineers have a background in computer science.

I found this interesting because it clearly shows how flexible a computer science degree really is when it comes to becoming a software engineer. It highlights that while CS is the most common and recommended path, there are multiple educational routes and specializations depending on the industry you want to work in. Different concentrations/areas of studies in college may also drive you towards a specific career path or branch.
